Creosote is a highly flammable substance that builds up inside your chimney or liner as a result of burning wood. The rate of accumulation can be higher if you practice poor burning practices or have a burning appliance or stove that is not working well. Different types of wood create different amounts of creosote when burned. Pine causes a rapid build-up of creosote and should be avoided as a regular source of wood. Creosote can also reduce the draw of the fireplace and reduce efficiency.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;When Should I Have My Chimney Inspected?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]To ensure that everything is working in order and operating as it should, we recommend that homeowners get their chimneys inspected annually. For the most part, homeowners opt to have their chimneys swept yearly as well, especially if they use their fireplaces regularly. Fireplace, stove, furnace and heating appliance systems are important to your home and family\u2019s safety and not an area to neglect or cut corners on. Don\u2019t risk the chance that an undiscovered defect could turn into an expensive repair or even worse \u2013 a chimney fire.<\/p>\n<p>If you rarely use your fireplace or stove, we still advise looking at all heating venting systems, chimneys, stove systems, and furnace flues. There may be some defects or issues that could be found that require attention, even if cleaning isn\u2019t needed.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;When Do I Need a Chimney Inspection?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]-If you haven\u2019t had your chimney inspected in a year or more<\/p>\n<p>-If you are having any performance issues with your chimney, fireplace, or heating system<\/p>\n<p>-If you have recently purchased\/moved into the home<\/p>\n<p>DON\u2019T WAIT! Almost always, waiting results in additional repairs and sometimes even property loss.<\/p>\n<p>Another important time to get your venting systems inspected is when you have upgraded or changed heating systems or added a stove or insert. An inspection will make sure that your chimney, lining and venting systems are adequate and in working order to handle the new changes.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not used your fireplace in a long time, pests may have built nests that could clog your flue or chimney chamber. Winter freeze cycles and moisture combine to take an annual toll on masonry and liner materials too. Over several years the deterioration will eventually require attention. Normal wear and tear that is left unchecked will affect the performance of your system. The longer the defects go without being addressed, the more expensive repairs are likely to be. Bottom line is \u2013 staying on top of your systems is not only the smartest and safest choice, it ends up being the most cost-effective too.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;How Often Should I get my Chimney Cleaned?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]This depends a lot on how much you use your fireplace or stove. The National Fire Protection Association says, \u201cChimneys, fireplaces, and vents shall be inspected at least once a year for soundness, freedom from deposits, and correct clearances. Cleaning, maintenance, and repairs shall be done if necessary.\u201d So, even if you don\u2019t use your chimney a whole lot \u2013 birds, squirrels, raccoons and other critters may have been using your chimney making it unsafe to use without clearing out the accumulated debris from nesting activity.<\/p>\n<p>The CSIA (Chimney Safety Institute of America) says that fireplaces should be cleaned when 1\/8\u2033 of sooty buildup is evident inside the chimney and flue system. If any glaze is appearing in the flue, cleaning should be done even if there is less than 1\/8\u2033 of buildup. Any time an appreciable accumulation of soot and creosote occurs it can be enough to fuel a chimney fire that may damage the chimney and even spread to the roof and home. Furnace flue systems also require cleaning, so don\u2019t neglect regular cleaning of those venting systems. Some heavy use fireplaces produce an incredible amount of soot and creosote during a cleaning.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;What is the Best Time to Clean my Chimney?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Ideally, before the start of the burning season during the spring, summer or early fall is a great time to get your chimney inspection and \/ or chimney cleaning.
