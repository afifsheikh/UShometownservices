The surety bond is a sign of our credibility, professionalism, and accountability.<\/p>\n<p>We are insured, which means you will not be held liable if a technician gets injured on your property. For instance, if a technician falls while repairing your garage door, you cannot be held liable for the injuries they suffer. Since we carry <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/t\/third-party-insurance.asp\">liability insurance<\/a>, the injured worker can file a claim against our insurance company and get the compensation they need.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>We Have Access to Nationwide Resources<\/h3>\n<p>We have been in the home services business for more than 20 years, during the course of which we have built a network of vendors, subcontractors, and other third parties that we can rely on.
