While there is nothing wrong with some self-care and relaxation during these stressful times, it is time to put things in order and prepare your office and home for life post-pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As businesses are reopening, you may want to hire professional cleaners for your residential or commercial property, to ensure everything is clean and safe before you settle back into a routine. But with so many home cleaning service providers in the market, how do you evaluate their reliability and pick someone that will deliver quality work? That\u2019s simple: choose a reputable home service provider that has all the necessary certifications in place!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Certified Air Duct Cleaners<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanitizing and cleaning your home\u2019s air ducts must be your first step towards a healthier life amidst the threat of coronavirus. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK224478\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several studies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have shown that health of people with respiratory and pulmonary issues improves drastically once their residential air ducts are professionally cleaned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the novel coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, it is vital to ensure that the air your family is breathing in is as clean as possible. Researchers have found that droplets of coronavirus can stay airborne for 10-15 minutes, during which your HVAC unit absorbs the particles into the air ducts and circulates the virus in other connected rooms.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular air duct cleaning by a NADCA (National Air Duct Cleaners Association) approved service provider, like United Home Services, ensures your ducts are functioning at optimal efficiency. Different bacteria and viruses can quickly accumulate in these ducts, so we go the extra mile in keeping your air ducts clean from harmful allergens and pollutants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At United Home Services, our professional expert cleaners are certified and trained in using industrial-grade disinfectants to keep the air ducts free from contaminants. We have access to state-of-the-art chemicals that can eradicate even the tiniest traces of coronavirus from your ducts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our potent disinfectants will thoroughly clean your air ducts from inside out, so much so that you will be able to tell the difference in your indoor air quality right away!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Benefits of Hiring NADCA-Certified Air Duct Cleaning Service<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The National Air Duct Cleaners Association is a non-profit organization that makes sure all the members commit to the highest standards for cleaning, safety, and evaluation of air ducts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a homeowner, you naturally want to hire a reliable company to handle the cleaning, repairs, or maintenance at your home. By hiring a NADCA-certified company, you will be able to reap the following benefits:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing excellence<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Air duct cleaning companies need to meet an extremely strict criterion in order to become certified by NADCA. At least one staff member must pass the NADCA exam and then attend regular seminars to maintain their certification.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, NADCA certification is not a one-and-done deal. Our NADCA-certified staff members at United Home Services must attend the seminars and further their industry education each year. Failure to do so can cause us to lose our license \u2013 which we do NOT take lightly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extensive knowledge<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Passing the NADCA exam requires thorough knowledge in HVAC design, indoor air quality, cleaning tactics, field experience, mechanical expertise, and much more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an air duct cleaning company has a NADCA certificate, it means their staff has the best practical knowledge in the industry, making them best equipped to handle your residential or commercial air ducts system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher standards of quality<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you haven\u2019t had anyone clean your home\u2019s air ducts or you are suffering from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccohs.ca\/oshanswers\/chemicals\/iaq_intro.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of poor-quality indoor air, we can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cleaning crew at United Home Services can assess and specify exactly what needs to be cleaned, i.e., air ducts, drains, registers, coils, grills, etc., and offer you a detailed explanation of how they will handle it. Our cleaning equipment exceeds the industry standards, and our customer service is second to none.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be a member of NADCA and maintain that status, we follow the stringent requirements that show a higher standard of quality assurance and performance, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We maintain general liability insurance<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We clean according to the NADCA standards, ACR, and NADCA\u2019s Code of Ethics<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have NADCA-certified air systems cleaning specialist (ASCS) in our team<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may come across numerous fly-by-night air duct cleaners that don\u2019t follow proper procedures and don\u2019t carry any liability insurance. Working with these contractors is a gamble; they can end up damaging your HVAC systems with their less-than-proper knowledge and lack of expertise. You may even have heard horror stories of contractors who disappeared into thin air as soon as they cashed their customers\u2019 checks, leaving behind more issues than solutions!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t risk your home or your money! Hire a fully-certified NADCA member and save yourself from potential trouble and losses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Certified Chimney Cleaners<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we specialize in several home services, it\u2019s only fair that we hold certifications for each service we provide. As we said earlier, we take our jobs very seriously and want to ensure that our customers feel we are doing the best we can for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This includes getting certified from the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Chimney Sweep Guild (<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncsg.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NCSG<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), which is considered the gold standard in chimney cleaning and maintenance services in the US. To get the NCSG certificate, the staff members of a chimney sweeping company must pass multiple examinations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best ways to ensure home service professionals can truly keep your home safe from the dangers associated with chimneys, fireplaces, and venting systems is by engaging with a NCSG-certified company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A chimney is a pivotal structure in a home. If it doesn\u2019t work properly, at the very least, it can cause damage to your home. At the very worst, it can cause severe injury, death, or destruction of your property.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Benefits of Hiring NCSG-Certified Chimney Cleaners<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chimney sweeping industry is largely unregulated, which means it can be tough to know if a company\u2019s credentials are as legit as they claim to be. Before you hire someone to sweep or repair your chimney, keep in mind that an improperly cleaned chimney can be disastrous for your home and family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why it\u2019s crucial to hire a company that has an independent third-party certification. And since the National Chimney Sweep Guild is a non-profit, nationally-recognized association with strict regulations, you can be sure that their members \u2013 like United Home Services \u2013 are adhering to the highest standards of quality and safety.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 1977, companies in the US and Canada have been seeking the NCSG certifications to establish their reputation in the industry, this means that for over 43 years, American homeowners have been trusting NCSG to help them find a qualified and reliable chimney cleaning company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Contact United Home Services<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at United Home Services, we have earned our NADCA and NCSG certification through hard work and diligence.
