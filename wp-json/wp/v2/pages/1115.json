Whether it\u2019s an indoor or outdoor unit, you must keep all filters clean and heat exchangers and coils free of restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend that your heating and cooling system be checked and serviced twice a year; ideally a spring and autumn tune-up. Also we recommend that you change your filter regularly, depending on the type of filter you have.

Loud heating and cooling equipment contribute to sound pollution. Although no financial savings are tied to lower sound levels, the sound rating of a cooling system can have a considerable effect on comfort and enjoyment of your home. The sound level of an air conditioner or heat pump depends on a variety of factors, such as the age and make of the unit, and whether the compressor is insulated or not can contribute to the amount of noise it makes.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;<b>At what temperature should I set my thermostat?<\/b>&#8221; tab_id=&#8221;1605281841926-4a227d70-f487&#8243;][vc_column_text]Is it making strange noises? Is it cooling or heating all areas of your home sufficiently? Has it been taking longer to cool down or heat up? Have your utility bills been rising for no apparent reason?

Unfortunately, these tactics only mask the odors, they don&#8217;t get rid of them. These remedies may in fact negatively affect indoor air quality from chemicals that cause allergic reactions or eye irritation for homeowners.<\/p>\n<p>Bacteria, dust mites, animal dander, cat saliva and mold may also be roots of your home&#8217;s odor problem. One method to purify the air is integrating germicidal (UV) lights in your home, which helps kill odors and inhibit the growth of biological contaminants, sterilizing surfaces in the HVAC system. They also purify the air, preventing the growth of contaminants. The UV lights are installed to work with your home comfort system.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes poor ventilation contributes to unpleasant odors. Moisture condensation on walls windows and stagnate air are signs of poor ventilation. A qualified Service Experts technician can inspect your home comfort system to determine if this is an issue that should be addressed. The technician can also inform you how to solve the ventilation system\u2019s ability to correctly circulate and ventilate indoor air.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;<b>How do I know which indoor air quality product is right for me?<\/b>&#8221; tab_id=&#8221;1475579716961-e174e8dd-343e&#8221;][vc_column_text]Every person and every home entails a different comfort need. The threshold of irritancy and triggers that affect people\u2019s health and comfort combine to determine the proper solutions. High threshold levels may require simple solutions like a better air filter. Low threshold levels may require an air purification system for the reduction of triggers and irritants.

Frequent dusting and vacuuming can help reduce the amount of dust and dust mites present in your home. However, not all airborne particles can be eliminated. Filtration devices can help eliminate particles that are too small to be caught by a vacuum. Some filtration devices include UV light units, air filters, energy recovery ventilators (ERVs), heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) and electronic air cleaners. A Home Health Report Card from Service Experts will provide the information about which indoor air improvement devices are right for you.
