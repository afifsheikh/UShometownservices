Proper maintenance can mean the difference between a safe or unsafe home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Duct Cleaning<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you suffer from allergies you know how harmful it is to neglect your ducts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The air ducts are almost like the lungs of your home; they circulate air throughout the house and keep it cool or warm depending on the temperature. Duct cleaning is important because your interior environment becomes cleaner as the dust that would otherwise circulate the house and land everywhere is removed. Duct cleaning also reduces the number of allergens and other irritants that are residing inside your property such as bacteria, pollen, spores, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good duct cleaning will help clear your airways which in turn will help you breathe better. A professional cleaning will also be able to get rid of any mold growth as a result of the moisture air conditioning units bring. Cleaning out your ducts will also result in the house smelling much better as odors accumulate in air ducts and then get circulated in the home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another bonus of cleaning out your ducts is that your temperature control will operate at peak efficiency not having its airways restricted in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Vent Cleaning<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You should periodically clean up your dryer\u2019s vent. Otherwise, it will start gathering lint and eventually clog.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lint and very hot air make for a dangerous combination. When you have too much lint, it can become a fire hazard. Fire aside, when your vent is clogged your dryer will not work properly; you will have to run it several times to get your load of laundry dry which takes not just extra time but extra power. In the long run, you save money by just vent cleaning alone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through vent cleaning, you do not have to add unnecessary stress to your clothes, and you won\u2019t run the risk of starting a fire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Chimney Cleaning<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule of thumb is to have your chimney swept at least once a year. Creosote is the residue that is left behind when you use your chimney, and the more you use it, the quicker it will build.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever the creosote and soot build a lining of 1\/8&#8242; it can pose a fire hazard and should be taken care of immediately. Even when you don&#8217;t use the chimney, chimney cleaning should be performed periodically as birds may use it to nest, leaving behind debris that can ignite a fire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Call United Home Services Today<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find yourself in need of home cleaning services, don\u2019t hesitate at all in contacting the professionals at United Home Services.
