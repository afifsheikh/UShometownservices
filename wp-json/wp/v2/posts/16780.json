In fact, with the new risks posed by the Delta variant, some experts believe that we might be headed for<a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6081407\/covid-19-fourth-wave\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> another wave<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What it means is that you cannot afford to let your guard down any time soon. And, you need to take all possible safety precautions. One such precaution you need to take is improving your indoor air quality. You can hire a professional home services provider that can suggest and execute simple steps. These tips will significantly improve your indoor air quality.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Indoor Air Quality and COVID-19 \u2013 What You Need to Know<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts say that the risk of coming into contact with airborne contaminants is fairly high in enclosed spaces. The lower the air quality, the higher are the risks of viral transmission. The best way to reduce this risk is to install a high-quality HVAC system. In particular, it can filter out airborne contaminants and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/coronavirus\/air-cleaners-hvac-filters-and-coronavirus-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> increase indoor air quality<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, in poorly ventilated spaces, the air you breathe out tends to get re-circulated again and again. As a result, this increases the risk of viral transmission. While natural ventilation (keeping your windows and doors open whenever possible) can prevent this problem to a certain extent, only a proper ventilation system can prevent recirculation of air, increase the rate of air change, and reduce the risk of viral transmission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Three Steps You Can Take to Increase Indoor Air Quality<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Inspect your HVAC system by a<a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/certifications\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> NADCA (National Air Duct Cleaners Association) approved technician<\/a>. If your air duct is clogged up with dirt and debris, it can push through dirt, mold, pathogens, and other contaminants, which can reduce indoor air quality. So, make sure you find someone to clean it regularly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Get your air conditioning unit inspected by a qualified AC technician. If your AC filter is dirty, it can result in the buildup of allergens, contaminants, and harmful pathogens, which can get released into the air you breathe in. If you are suffering from asthma, allergies, or pulmonary disorders, breathing in dirty air can worsen your symptoms and severely affect your health in the long term. So, make sure to clean and inspect your AC filter on a regular basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Get your home insulation system inspected by a qualified technician. If your insulation system is not working properly due to water damage or mold growth, it can not only increase your energy bills but also affect indoor air quality. So, it is important to fix the issues or upgrade your insulation system if necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Worried about Indoor Air Quality?
