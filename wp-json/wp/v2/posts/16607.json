Has it been months? If you haven\u2019t had your AC inspected this year, you may have some problems and surprise repair bills waiting around the corner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Why Austin AC Inspection Matters<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every summer, your AC works super hard to keep your abode cool. And Austin summers are no joke. Over time, the wear-and-tear of everyday work can cause issues for your air conditioner. Without carrying out routine maintenance, its components can start to break down, impacting the cooling efficiency of the unit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you schedule an<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/ac-installation\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin AC inspection <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with United Home Services, our certified professionals will perform a thorough inspection of your unit. They will look out for potential problems with the AC and make sure all the components are working properly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If any of the AC components are nearing the end of their lifespan, we will recommend repair before the system breaks down in the middle of a hot summer. Scheduling routine Austin AC inspections ensure that your unit is going to perform well for several years to come. A trained AC repair professional can also help reduce your energy bills by increasing the efficiency of your unit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3 Ways Austin AC Inspection Can Improve Your System\u2019s Performance\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular AC inspections help shed light on issues you may not have noticed about your system. This includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduced risk of breakdowns<\/span><\/i><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our 20+ years of repairing air conditioners, we have observed that most repairs could have been avoided if the homeowner had invested just a sliver of time on a routine inspection and servicing of the AC. Also, some AC manufacturers will void the product warranty if you don\u2019t get the unit inspected on an annual basis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better indoor air quality<\/span><\/i><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16618 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-AC-Inspection600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"austin ac inspection\u00a0\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-AC-Inspection600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-AC-Inspection600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-AC-Inspection600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Does it seem that you or someone in your home is constantly battling colds or allergies? Does the air in your home seem stuffy? If yes, this could be because your air conditioner and its ducts have accumulated a lot of dirt and dust over the months (or years).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As your air conditioner works, it collects all sorts of debris, like dirt, pollen, and even<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lung.org\/clean-air\/at-home\/indoor-air-pollutants\/cockroaches\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cockroach parts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! So, make sure you schedule an Austin AC inspection every 6-8 months so the experts can remove these pollutants from the unit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better cooling<\/span><\/i><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an AC is failing to cool your home, its components may be overworked. As the components churn harder and harder, they require more energy than normally needed, leading to lukewarm airflow and higher energy bills.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies show that regular AC inspections can help homeowners save up to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.energystar.gov\/campaign\/heating_cooling\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20% on energy bills<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by identifying and fixing inefficient heating and cooling systems. If your cooling bills are unexpectedly higher, it\u2019s likely that your AC unit has a leak or a faulty component. It\u2019s recommended to call an Austin AC inspection expert to diagnose and fix the issue to improve performance and pare down power bills.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Is Your AC Performing Optimally?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By investing in an Austin AC inspection every few months, you can ensure that your system is keeping you cool throughout the scorching weather in Austin.
