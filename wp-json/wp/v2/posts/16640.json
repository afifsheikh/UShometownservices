Some homeowners have their chimney cleaned once a year, some do it every few months, and some can\u2019t remember the last time their chimney received any attention at all!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA), your chimney should be thoroughly inspected and swept<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.csia.org\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least once a year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 regardless of how often you use it or how modern your fireplace is. In fact, if you don\u2019t use your fireplace and chimney on a regular basis, you are in most need of a sweeping because you may not notice performance issues that indicate bigger problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Often Should Chimneys Be Cleaned And Inspected<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfpa.org\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Fire Protection Agency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is in agreemqent with the CSIA; they recommend that your fireplace, chimney, and vents should be inspected at least every 12 months for correct clearances, freedom from deposits, and soundness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it turns out during the initial inspection that the chimney and\/or the fireplace need any repair or maintenance, you should have it addressed right away. So, the rule of thumb is to call a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/certifications\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professional chimney sweep<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> every year, so you can have the peace of mind you need to enjoy using your fireplace throughout the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Signs Your Chimney Needs To Be Cleaned<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While annual cleaning and upkeep is recommended for all homeowners, there are certain signs that indicate it\u2019s time to have the chimney swept.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>You Use the Fireplace Frequently<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use your stove or fireplace pretty often, especially as a primary heat source, you may need to call the chimney sweep more than once a year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSIA suggests that your chimney should be cleaned any time the soot accumulation reaches 1\/8<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of an inch. This usually happens after you\u2019ve burned a full cord of wood. If you are burning more than one full cord during a single burning season, you should call the chimney sweep at least twice a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Your Fireplace Has Been Inactive For A While<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16652 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-Often-Should-Chimneys-Be-Cleaned-and-Inspected_600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"how often should chimneys be cleaned and inspected\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-Often-Should-Chimneys-Be-Cleaned-and-Inspected_600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-Often-Should-Chimneys-Be-Cleaned-and-Inspected_600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/How-Often-Should-Chimneys-Be-Cleaned-and-Inspected_600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>If it\u2019s been several weeks or years since you last used the fireplace, the chimney may have accumulated animal nests, dried leaves and twigs, and other debris. So, before you ignite a fire and start using the fireplace, call a chimney sweep \u2013 even if the last cleaning was less than a year ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Your Chimney Is Displaying Performance Issues<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you smell a weird odor coming from the chimney even when the fireplace is not burning? Does the room fill with smoke whenever you use the fireplace? Is the fire not burning strong enough, like it used to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of these questions, it\u2019s time to schedule a chimney sweeping appointment. If you\u2019re wondering how often chimneys should be cleaned and inspected, in this case, the answer is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as soon as you notice a problem with it<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Call a Certified &amp; Experienced Chimney Sweep Today<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike your state-of-the-art oven, a chimney doesn\u2019t come with a self-cleaning option (though, it would be nice\u2026). Neglected fireplaces and chimneys can wreak havoc on the structure of your beloved home, so it\u2019s best to schedule a chimney inspection and cleaning at least once a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re still not sure how often chimneys should be cleaned and inspected, call us and we will give you a precise answer after inspecting your chimney.
