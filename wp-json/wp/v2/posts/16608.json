Considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, you may have even decided to do the duct cleaning yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We understand that there are circumstances where you may not want to hire a professional for<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/air-duct\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">duct cleaning in Texas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Maybe you are watching your wallet or you&#8217;ve had some experience cleaning the ductwork in your home; you can try doing this yourself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you\u2019ll need to keep a few things in mind before you start your DIY duct cleaning project:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be ready to uncover some gross stuff! If it\u2019s been a while since your last duct cleaning, you are likely to uncover dirt, mold, dead insects, insects\u2019 feces, etc. inside the ducts.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you probably don\u2019t have industrial-grade rotary brushes and vacuums at your disposal, you won\u2019t achieve the same results that a professional company for duct cleaning in Texas can give you.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find mold during the cleaning, you\u2019ll need to call a professional to remove it. Handling mold can be dangerous; only an expert can remove it completely and safely from the ducts.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Risks of Duct Cleaning<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also be aware of the risks that come with cleaning the ducts yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less Effective Cleaning<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: We have already mentioned this before but it can\u2019t be stressed enough. While you may succeed in improving the indoor air quality with your DIY efforts, your hard work won\u2019t be half as effective as a professional duct cleaning in Texas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You won\u2019t be able to reach every little corner that experts can with their professional equipment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duct Damage<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you have<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Duct_(flow)#Flexible_ducting\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flexible (or flex) ducts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you are likely to tear or damage the ducts when doing the cleaning yourself. Flex ducts are made from thin sheets of plastic and are highly susceptible to damage. Even a tiny hole in the ducts can reduce the airflow inside your home, making your HVAC system less effective.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What To Do If DIY Duct Cleaning In Texas Is Not For You\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16620 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Duct-Cleaning-in-Texas600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"duct cleaning in texas\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Duct-Cleaning-in-Texas600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Duct-Cleaning-in-Texas600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Duct-Cleaning-in-Texas600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>If this sounds like a lot, you\u2019d be better off with hiring a reliable company for duct cleaning in Texas that\u2019s certified by the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nadca.com\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Air Duct Cleaners Association<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (NADCA).
