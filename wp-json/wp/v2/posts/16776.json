But with snow comes the cold. That part is not quite as fun, at least for most people, which is why having a fireplace and chimney is so popular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing quite like the smell of wooden logs burning, the sound of the wood crackling, and the warmth from the fire place. It is almost entrancing. But before you get to enjoy the fire this winter you have to make sure your <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/chimney-cleaning\/\">chimney<\/a> is clean, here is why:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creosote<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, from channeling the smoke from every fire, the chimney gets a lining of something called creosote.&nbsp; Creosote is mostly made of tar and is highly flammable in the advanced stages. It comes in three stages, the first is harmless, mostly soot and ash, this is easy enough to remove. Stage two is not quite as simple as the first, you get tar flakes that restrict the air and can cause a fire. The final stage is more difficult to clear out, in some cases the creosote will be so hard that a new chimney liner might be the only solution. In this stage, the creosote is the tar that hardens and restricts the air even more than the second stage. This type of tar-like substance is very dangerous because it acts like fuel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Health<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The buildup in your chimney can cause the smoke to go in the house and possibly cause health concerns. If your chimney has blockages the heating will not be very effective. It also has the potential to make your home smell rather bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Critters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason to clean your chimney is that critters love chimneys to nest. Birds and squirrels or even raccoons can get to the inside of your chimney easily enough. Once they are there they usually like it as it offers them protection from the elements. When this happens, the animal in question usually piles up all sorts of debris they pick up elsewhere to make their nest more comfortable. If you try lighting a fire and do not realize you have a guest living rent-free things may not go so well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice any of these signs, you know you need a chimney cleaning:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visible oily spots near the fireplace<\/li><li>When your logs do not burn well<\/li><li>An unpleasant smell coming from the fireplace smells<\/li><li>The sound of rustling leaves coming from the chimney\/fireplace<\/li><li>Smoke is not reaching the top of the chimney<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these are tell-tale signs that there is not enough airflow which probably results in fires being hard to light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reach Out To Us<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need your home serviced in any way, you have reached the right site.
