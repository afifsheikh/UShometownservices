According to the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usfa.fema.gov\/prevention\/outreach\/clothes_dryers.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US Fire Administration<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, nearly 3,000 dryer vent fires occur each year, resulting in 5 deaths and about $35 million of property loss. Clogged dryer vents are generally the main cause of these fire accidents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it goes without saying that you should be very diligent and careful while hiring a Texas dryer vent cleaner. To ensure you hire the right people, you need to keep a few factors in mind. If your chosen vent cleaners display any of the following red flags, steer clear of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They lack experience or reputation<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long have they been in business? You can tell a few things by the length of time a Texas dryer vent cleaner has been in business, including how reliable and experienced they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure the professionals you hire for vent cleaning have been around long enough to acquire the experience necessary to get the job done right, the first time. They must also be in compliance with the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nadca.com\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Air Duct Cleaners Association<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (NADCA), as well as other state and federal regulations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They have negative customer reviews\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the company has negative reviews online, or you simply can\u2019t find any of their previous customers\u2019 testimonials, it is a bad sign. You should always ask for references when hiring someone to work inside your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas dryer vent cleaner worth its salt will be happy to provide references, but if they refuse to do so, ignore them and find someone else. You need to know what people have said about their experiences with the company. Look for signs that the vent cleaning technicians are skilled, dedicated, and trustworthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They don\u2019t have liability insurance<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We cannot stress enough the importance of<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.allstate.com\/tr\/insurance-basics\/liability-coverage.aspx\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">liability insurance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! As a homeowner, you do NOT want to end up stuck with a huge bill if a technician is injured on your property or your home is damaged during the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every reputable <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas dryer vent cleaner will have liability insurance, and they will be happy to show you the relevant documents to prove it. Unless they provide you with written proof of insurance, do not risk your home and savings by hiring them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They have shady pricing practices<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, when homeowners hire a handyman, they end up paying more than the quoted price. This happens when the service company resorts to scammy practices and forces their customers to pay more to receive a complete service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some vent cleaning companies can entice you with an \u201call-inclusive price of $49\u201d and then perform an incomplete or mediocre job. Then they will tell you that you must pay extra to get the whole, promised job done. So, if an offer seems too good to be true, beware of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They are not taking measures to keep you safe\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16614 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Texas-Dryer-Vent-Cleaner600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"texas dryer vent cleaner\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Texas-Dryer-Vent-Cleaner600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Texas-Dryer-Vent-Cleaner600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Texas-Dryer-Vent-Cleaner600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Vent cleaning can be a messy business, and the ongoing pandemic hasn\u2019t helped. You need to look for a Texas dryer vent cleaner that uses personal protective equipment while performing their jobs, and apply plastic guards to protect your home. Their technicians should also wear shoe covers to keep from tracking dirt and debris throughout your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, don\u2019t forget to ask the company what kind of vetting process they have in place for hiring their technicians. Feel free to ask for technicians who have years of experience on a variety of dryer vents, and make sure the company conducts thorough background checks before hiring.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Don\u2019t Take A Risk: Hire #1 Trustworthy Texas Dryer Vent Cleaner\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you notice any of the above signs, it\u2019s time to move on and find a company that\u2019s known for their quality work and stellar reputation.
