But that\u2019s not entirely true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insulating your home can also help you reduce your energy consumption, significantly lowering your electricity bills. In fact, one of the most effective ways to save energy is by insulating your entire home as it will keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Environmental Protection Agency, you can<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.energystar.gov\/campaign\/seal_insulate\/methodology\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">save 15%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on cooling and heating costs by adding insulation in your basement, crawl space, and attic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This post will help you understand why<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/contact\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">insulation installation, Allentown<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, PA, is so important and how you can use it to make your home more energy efficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What is Home Insulation, Allentown, PA?<\/b><\/h2>\n<h2><b><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16450\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/About-More-Than-Warmth-Why-Home-Insulation-is-an-Essential-Service-for-Your-Home-600-x-600-300x300.png\" alt=\"home insulation allentown\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/About-More-Than-Warmth-Why-Home-Insulation-is-an-Essential-Service-for-Your-Home-600-x-600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/About-More-Than-Warmth-Why-Home-Insulation-is-an-Essential-Service-for-Your-Home-600-x-600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/About-More-Than-Warmth-Why-Home-Insulation-is-an-Essential-Service-for-Your-Home-600-x-600-320x320.png 320w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/About-More-Than-Warmth-Why-Home-Insulation-is-an-Essential-Service-for-Your-Home-600-x-600-360x360.png 360w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/About-More-Than-Warmth-Why-Home-Insulation-is-an-Essential-Service-for-Your-Home-600-x-600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insulation is material used to reduce heat gain or heat loss by providing a barrier between your home interior and the outside temperature. It helps you keep the desired temperature in your home throughout the year and protects it against excess heat in summer and cold in winter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another lesser-known but incredible benefit of insulation installation Allentown, PA, is it reduces noise pollution. So, if you have a particularly noisy neighbor or a teenager who loves listening to loud music, insulation will help cancel out that noise significantly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are wondering how much money you can save on energy bills by adding insulation, it will depend on a lot of factors like the size of your house and the type of insulation you choose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most modern houses are built with insulation but if your house is older, it\u2019s likely without insulation. You can choose to insulate your doors, windows, walls, floors, attic, basement, and crawlspace. The most important thing you need to insulate is your walls since house walls lose around 30-40% of the heat during winters.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Type Of Insulation Installation, Allentown, PA is Best?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are different qualities and materials, but all good insulators are made up of a substance that\u2019s very much like wool. Fabrics like hemp and cotton are excellent insulators, and wood-based materials are also a good choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also go for spray foam or fiberglass insulation, which are a bit expensive but well worth their cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend contacting an insulation expert to check out your house and determine which material will suit you best, based on your budget and the weather you live in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Save Money on Your Next Energy Bill with Home Insulation<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By insulating your home, you\u2019ll reduce your energy consumption and lower the amount of polluting gases that are emitted into the environment to produce that energy. In this way, you will be doing your part in cutting down your carbon footprint and protecting the atmosphere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are ready to make your home more energy efficient and save a ton of money in the process, schedule a free consultation for home insulation, Allentown, PA, with United Home Services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our certified and licensed insulation installers have over 20+ years of experience in the industry.
