But the truth is, the most dangerous contaminants lurk <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inside<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your home. Dust, animal feces, dead animal&#8217;s body parts, and household cleaners are just a few pollutants that make your indoor air quality unhealthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it\u2019s safe to assume that you and your family are spending the majority of your time indoors. So, if you\u2019re looking to improve the Austin air quality in your home, look no further. Here are the most effective ways you can clarify the indoor air and breathe easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Buy Indoor-Friendly Houseplants<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why not improve the Austin air quality the same way that Mother Nature does? Buy some<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bhg.com.au\/best-air-cleaning-plants\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">succulents and plants<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and place them around your home, especially in your bedroom and living room. Plants such as peace lily, chrysanthemums, Boston fern, rubber plants, English ivy, and aloe vera actively remove toxins from the air.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Clean the Filters In Your HVAC System<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The filter in your air conditioner or furnace is the first line of defense against indoor pollution. These filters trap mold, viruses, and bacteria, and prevent them from entering your home via ductwork. This is why it\u2019s crucial to change these filters on a regular basis. A filter that\u2019s clogged up with dirt, dust, and other tiny debris cannot purify your indoor air. Consider calling an<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/air-duct\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HVAC expert<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to check the Austin air quality in your home if it\u2019s been a while since your last HVAC maintenance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Get Air Circulation Going<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless it\u2019s extremely cold or hot outside, you must open your doors and windows every day. This allows the dusty and stale air to escape the house and lets the fresh, clean air enter indoors. If you don\u2019t have an exhaust fan in your basement, attic, or other closed-up spaces, consider getting one installed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Keep An Eye On Humidity Levels\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mold and dust mites thrive in moist environments, so make sure you maintain ideal humidity levels in your home. This is usually between 30 and 50%. We recommend getting a humidifier that can reduce the amount of moisture in your home\u2019s air. In addition, a humidifier also prevents mold and other allergens from taking root indoors. If you already have a humidifier, make sure you empty out the drip pans on a regular basis.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Stop Smoking!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16659 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-Air-Quality600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"austin air quality\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-Air-Quality600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-Air-Quality600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-Air-Quality600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>If you\u2019ve heard it once, you\u2019ve heard it a thousand times. But seriously, cigarette smoke can wreak havoc on your indoor air quality. Breathing in air that\u2019s been contaminated with cigarette smoke can increase the risk of asthma, heart problems, respiratory ailments, and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/cancer-causes\/tobacco-and-cancer\/secondhand-smoke.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even cancer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s time to make your home a non-smoking space. If you smoke, and you have other people living in your home, especially little children, think about the risks you\u2019re exposing them to.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Clean Austin Air Quality Indoors Doesn\u2019t Have To Be Expensive<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breathing in clean, fresh air is your right. You don\u2019t need to invest in expensive air purification systems to improve the air quality in your home.
