Does it take longer than usual to dry your clothes? If so, it might be a poignant idea for you to clean your dryer vent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dirty, clogged-up dryer vent can not only increase your utility bill but increase the risk of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usfa.fema.gov\/prevention\/outreach\/clothes_dryers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> dryer fires<\/a>, which are responsible for several deaths and injuries every year. In this post, we will talk about four safety precautions you need to take while cleaning your dryer vent. Consider these the golden rules that any good Texas dryer vent cleaner will advise you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Switch off the Power<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound so obvious, but many people forget to do it. It is \u2013 as any Texas dryer vent cleaner can tell you \u2013 very dangerous. So, make sure you unplug the cord or turn off the gas before you start cleaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Wear a Mask<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have not cleaned your dryer vent for a long time, it might be filled with lint, dirt, hair, and other particles that might be harmful to you to breathe in. So, make sure you wear a mask for the sake of your health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Do Not Bend the Duct Too Much<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bending the duct in weird angles is not a good idea, as it can make it easier for lint particles to accumulate in the crevices. Therefore, handle it with care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Attach the Vent Hose Properly<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure the vent is attached properly \u2013 especially if you have a gas dryer. If it is not securely attached, it can result in the buildup of carbon monoxide, which is<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/carbon-monoxide\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20370642\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> poisonous<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that despite your best efforts, you might not be able to clean your dryer vent as thoroughly as it needs to be cleaned. Especially, if your dryer has a long duct, it might not be possible for you to clean it with the basic equipment that you have. This is why it\u2019s judicious to hire a professional to get your dryer vent cleaned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Advantages of Hiring a Texas Dryer Vent Cleaner<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dryer vent cleaners are professionals who have the expertise and training to clean dryer vents the right way.

They can do a better, more thorough job than you can due to their experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A seasoned<a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/dryer-vent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Texas dryer vent cleaner<\/a> can not only clean your vent but also inspect it for other problems that might affect the machine\u2019s efficiency or put your safety and wellbeing at risk.
