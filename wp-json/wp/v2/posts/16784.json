Before you Google \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/chimney-cleaning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">chimney service near me<\/a>\u2019, make sure you read this post fully. In this article, we tell you how often you should get your chimney inspected, why it is important to do so, and how you can find a reliable chimney sweep company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Often Should I Have My Chimney Inspected?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, you should have your chimney inspected by a certified technician at least once a year. If any issues could affect your chimney\u2019s performance or pose a risk to your family\u2019s safety and wellbeing, the technician can detect them early and get them fixed so that you can avoid extensive repairs down the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Is It Important to Have My Chimney Inspected Regularly?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary reason why you should have your chimney inspected regularly is to detect the buildup of creosote \u2013 a dark-colored particle that is made of tar. The problem with creosote is that it is highly flammable. A buildup of creosote can lead to a<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chimney_fire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> chimney fire<\/a>, which can not only damage your chimney but the rest of your house as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from this, regular inspections can also help you detect and fix a number of other issues that can affect your chimney\u2019s performance, efficiency, and lifespan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>I Just Moved Into a New Home. Should I Call a Chimney Service Near Me?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you should. Any time you move into a new place, you should have the chimney inspected by a qualified professional and make sure it is in proper working condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>I Think There Is an Obstruction in the Chimney. Should I Call a Chimney Service Near Me?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you absolutely must! Chimney obstructions are dangerous and can lead to the buildup of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/co\/faqs.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> carbon monoxide<\/a>, which can be deadly. In fact, you should call a chimney sweep company right away \u2013 regardless of when you had your chimney inspected \u2013 if you notice the following signs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visible buildup of soot inside the chimney<\/li><li>Cracked or damaged bricks<\/li><li>Damaged or missing chimney cap or chase cover<\/li><li>Wallpaper or paint damage near the chimney area<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Do I Know If the Chimney Service Near Me Is Reliable?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ask the following questions to determine whether a chimney sweep company is as good as they claim to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do they have an NCSG (National Chimney Sweep Guild) certification?<\/li><li>Do they have a team of in-house technicians who are licensed, bonded, and insured?<\/li><li>Are they reputable? What do their customers say about them?<\/li><li>Do they provide emergency repair services?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>United Home Services \u2013 Chimney Services You Can Trust<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to have your chimney inspected, there is no need to Google \u2018chimney service near me\u2019.
