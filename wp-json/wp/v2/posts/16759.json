And like any investment, it should be protected by doing everything in your power to keep it in its optimum state. This can mean a variety of things such as vent cleaning, duct cleaning, and quite a few other activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Air Conditioning<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First on the list is AC installation or repair. AC units are a lifesaver during summer, they help you take a break from the heat and make your home cool and comfortable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you need <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/air-duct\/\">vent cleaning<\/a> or a general inspection, AC units should only be serviced by professionals. It is not just the AC unit but the ducts connected to it as well. If the air ducts are not clean they could make the house smell and cause all sorts of breathing issues. Without proper maintenance mold and air pathogens can take hold, so make sure you\u2019re provided with the right duct cleaning when necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Chimney Cleaning And Inspections<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chimney fires can be devastating to your home but are easy to prevent. Creosote is a very flammable substance that will build up along the lining of the chimney and eventually cause a problem. At least once a year or so you should get <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/chimney-cleaning\/\">chimney cleaning and inspection services<\/a>, especially if you use the fireplace regularly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Roofing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be argued that there is no part of your home as important as your roof as they protect you from the outside elements amongst other things.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small roof leak can turn into a massive headache costing tens of thousands of dollars. Leaks also make the home unsafe and have a habit of staying under the radar until it\u2019s too late. You should have your <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/roofing\/\">roof inspected and serviced<\/a> to avoid any problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Dryer Vent Inspection, Cleaning &amp; Repair<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dryer Vents can become clogged and cause problems. When lint accumulates it blocks the airflow, which can usually be seen towards the end of the duct or in any of the bends. When the vent becomes clogged the dryer will not work properly and the lint can potentially become a fire hazard. If you ever run your dryer and realize you need to run it multiple times to get your clothes dry, it is probably due to lint blocking the airflow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Garage Door Repair And Installation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last on the list but no less important is your <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/garage-doors\/\">garage door<\/a>. If you ever come home, click on the remote control, and find to your surprise that the garage door is not responding, it could be an easy fix. Give us a call and we may be able to get it up and running in no time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you need a new garage door installed or your current one serviced, you can depend on us to do the best possible job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Reach Out To United Home Services Today<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are in need of home services, look no further.
