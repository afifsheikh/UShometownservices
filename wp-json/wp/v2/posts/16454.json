If you don\u2019t clean them out regularly, this can lead to longer drying times. The dryer will need to work harder to function properly, causing it to overheat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To top it off, lint is highly flammable. Combined with overheating, it can increase the risk of a house fire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your dryer isn\u2019t working right or has stopped working, it might be time to clean the vents or replace the whole thing.

A replacement may not be necessary in this situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outside of the dryer is hot to the touch<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another common sign is when the exterior of the dryer as well as your clothing are both extremely hot. A well-functioning dryer doesn\u2019t get much hot during a normal cycle. Your clothing is supposed to be a bit warm, but dry and fluffy as the cycle ends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the clothes are abnormally hot and also seem damp after the drying cycle, it means there is an issue with your dryer vents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that running the dryer through an extra cycle is not a solution in this situation. If you do that, you will cause the heating parts to burn out which can lead the lint buildup to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thespruce.com\/dryer-vent-lint-fire-hazard-2145839\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">catch fire.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes more than 1 normal cycle to dry your clothing<\/span><\/i><\/h3>\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16456\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-300x157.png\" alt=\"dryer vent cleaning local\" width=\"300\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-300x157.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-1024x536.png 1024w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-768x402.png 768w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-320x167.png 320w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-640x335.png 640w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-360x188.png 360w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-720x377.png 720w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-1080x565.png 1080w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-800x419.png 800w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628-150x79.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/New-Dryer-or-Dryer-Vent-Cleaning-Which-Will-Fix-My-Dryer-Problem-1200-x-628.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/span><\/i><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does your clothing take 2-3 times the usual time to dry completely? If yes, then it could mean that lint buildup may be clogging the vents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thespruce.com\/select-the-correct-dryer-cycle-2146145\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, dry times<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are around 30-45 minutes. Any longer than that means lint might be preventing your clothes from receiving dry air. This will also put a huge pressure on the dryer, causing it to overheat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If left unchecked, this can damage the heating element, forcing you to spend a lot of money on repairs or a brand-new dryer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dryer that takes longer to run also consumes a lot of extra energy and can significantly increase your energy bills.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You notice a burning smell when running the dryer<\/span><\/i><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you smell a burning odor when the dryer is running? It means lint has accumulated in the vent as well as the other important parts of the dryer like the lint trap, exhaust tube, and drum casting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as you notice the burning smell, shut the dryer off right away and call a dryer vent cleaner near me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you notice any of these issues, you may need to call in professional dryer vent technicians. And if your dryer is more than ten years old and you have already gotten it repaired several times in the past, it might be time to buy a new one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Dryer Not Working?
