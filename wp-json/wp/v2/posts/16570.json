This is a city that seems to face<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kvue.com\/article\/weather\/record-breaking-108-degrees-recorded-in-austin-monday-temperatures-trend-slightly-cooler-tuesday\/269-9ee8e8ff-147f-41c8-bc54-13ff5e94d4d7\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record-breaking heat<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> every year! And just imagine if your AC breaks down in the middle of the night\u2026because you didn\u2019t keep up with the annual inspections and maintenance.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you\u2019ve been diligent with the maintenance and your AC unit still keeps dying on you, it might be time to think about a replacement. We recommend calling a reliable Austin AC installation company to determine whether you need to buy a new system or a simple repair job will be enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>5 Signs You Need To Call An Austin AC Installation Expert<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re on the fence about whether to keep having the unit fixed or replace it altogether, here are a few common signs that can help you make a decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AC unit is 10 or more years old<\/span><\/i><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The approximate lifespan of an air conditioner is 10 years, and that\u2019s considering if you kept up with the annual maintenance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your AC is more than 10 years old and running fine, you should still consider replacing it because HVAC technology today has improved significantly in the past 10 years. Air conditioners manufactured today run smoother, quieter, and are more energy-efficient. Installing a new unit can help you save a lot on utility bills.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AC unit is not cooling much<\/span><\/i><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whole point of having an air conditioner is so you can enjoy cool air to keep you and your family comfortable, regardless of the hot weather outside. If this is not happening and your AC is not cooling the way it should be, call<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin AC <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/ac-installation\/\">installation services<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to check what\u2019s wrong with the unit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it\u2019s a minor repair job, you\u2019re good. But if the problem persists to such a degree that the AC repair guy seems to have become a new member of your family, it\u2019s time to buy a new AC.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AC unit uses R-22 freon as a refrigerant<\/span><\/i><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your AC is 10 or more years old, there\u2019s a good chance that it\u2019s running on<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/aaa1hvac.com\/r-22-refrigerant-homeowners-need-know\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">R-22 freon.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The US government has started phasing out this refrigerant due to its extremely harmful impact on the ozone layer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you consider yourself environmentally-conscious, contact Austin AC installation experts and buy a new AC that\u2019s more energy-efficient.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AC unit is making a lot of noise<\/span><\/i><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your AC sounds like it\u2019s just about to fall apart, something is seriously wrong with it. Noises like hissing, thumping, squeaking, ticking, or clanking should not be coming from your AC! These strange sounds usually mean that the AC is very old and can die any minute. Call Austin AC installation professionals without any delay.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AC unit generates consistently higher utility bills<\/span><\/i><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16581 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-AC-Installation600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"austin ac installation\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-AC-Installation600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-AC-Installation600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin-AC-Installation600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Does it seem that your cooling bills are getting higher and higher? It could be because your AC needs more energy now to keep working effectively. As time passes, many units lose the ability to cool your home as well as they once did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turning your thermostat down a few degrees may make you feel more comfortable, but it won\u2019t solve the problem. Your AC will simply start working harder and increase your utility bills as a result.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>100% Satisfaction Guaranteed: Call Us Today!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still not sure if you need a new AC?
