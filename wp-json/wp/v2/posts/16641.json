Unfortunately, many homeowners tend to put off taking care of their chimney unless absolutely necessary. This is clearly NOT a preferable strategy because we all know what happens when we avoid addressing the small issues \u2013 they turn into big and, in this case, expensive problems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you\u2019ve decided to hire one of the chimney cleaning companies near you to be proactive towards your chimney maintenance, good for you! There are a lot of companies out there that claim to offer the best services for the best prices, but you need to be cautious when making the final decision. In this post, we have broken down some major factors that will help you choose the most reliable and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/chimney-cleaning\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experienced chimney sweep<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They Must Be Fully Insured and Certified<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a chimney servicing company is not insured or certified, steer clear of them. Any company that\u2019s serious and dedicated about what they do, will have taken the time and effort to get liability insurance and earn some certifications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for a company that\u2019s certified by the<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncsg.org\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Chimney Sweep Guild<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (NCSG) or Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA). This way, you can be 100% certain that you are working with professionals who can be trusted to sweep your chimney in the most efficient manner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They Must Have A Well-Established Reputation<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would you like to hire one of those fly-by-night chimney cleaning companies that can\u2019t give you any references? A good measure to consider when hiring any home service provider is to ensure they have been around for at least a decade or so. Service providers who have been in the business for that long have clearly earned trust from their customers \u2013 or they would have been forced to shut down many moons ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, United Home Services has been providing chimney inspection and cleaning services for over 22 years. We started as a small business in Texas, and today we have branches across five states! Remember, expertise and experience go hand in hand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They Must Offer A Thorough Inspection<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16658 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chimney-Cleaning-Companies600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"chimney cleaning companies\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chimney-Cleaning-Companies600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chimney-Cleaning-Companies600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chimney-Cleaning-Companies600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Any company that doesn\u2019t perform a comprehensive inspection before giving you a price quote about what needs fixing, should be avoided. When it comes to chimneys and fireplaces, making assumptions about<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.csia.org\/troubleshooting.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what might be wrong<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with them is not the solution. The chimney sweep must check out the chimney, the flue, and all of its parts as the very first step. If they suggest a bunch of repairs right off the bat, it\u2019s a huge red flag.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>They Must Be Pleasant To Interact With<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how many glowing testimonials or certifications a company has, if they don\u2019t treat you or your home with respect, you don\u2019t want to deal with them. Whether you are looking for a chimney sweep \u2013 or any other home service technician for that matter \u2013 choose one you feel comfortable talking to. If you feel uneasy or uncomfortable talking to them, the last thing you want is to invite them into your house to work on your chimney!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>One Of The Most Trustworthy Chimney Cleaning Companies Near You<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Home Services has been serving homeowners across the nation for more than 22 years.
