But if you are looking for someone to come clean your air system you should pay attention because it will make a huge difference. <a href=\"https:\/\/nadca.com\/sites\/default\/files\/nadca_homeowners_guide_web_version.pdf\">NADCA<\/a> stands for National Air <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/\">Duct Cleaners<\/a> Association and hiring a member ensures you will get a job done right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Certified Specialists<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/\">NADCA service provider<\/a> must get certified and then have that certification renewed periodically, the organization takes the education of its members very seriously and holds them to the highest standards. This ensures that the members will have a dedication to quality assurance and excellence that is unrivaled by anyone in the industry thus creating a \u201cgo-to\u201d place for top performance every time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a company to be considered a member, they must have at least one specialist that is NADCA certified in air systems cleaning in the permanent staff. The company must maintain general liability insurance and must adhere to ACR, the NADCA standards, and follow the code of ethics put forth by NADCA. With these requirements, a top-notch level of assurance is assured to you, the consumer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Membership Proof<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a contractor you are looking to hire claims to be a member, just ask them to offer you proof of membership and make sure the certification is up to date.&nbsp; If they are a member, you should be able to depend on them to clean the HVAC system components including the coils, drain, the air ducts, and the registers, the grills, air plenum, the blower motor, heat exchanger, the air filter, and the air cleaner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how often should you have your air ducts cleaned to ensure maximum efficiency? NADCA recommends doing a cleaning every 3 to 5 years. Depends on how much pollution they are exposed to. If you live in an area that is full of smog, you smoke in the house and cook a lot, probably 3 years is closer to the mark. If on the other hand you live in a place surrounded by nature, very little pollution and you keep the inside of your home clean and dust-free, five years is just fine. Even if you live in the cleanest place on the planet and you meticulously clean the house you will still need to do a proper cleaning at least every 5 years because the condensation from the cold air tends to grow mold. This mold can affect your respiratory system negatively and the only way to prevent it is proper cleaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reach Out To Us<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your home service needs, you have come to the right place.
