How long your system lasts totally depends on how well you maintain it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your AC doesn\u2019t receive any care, it may not even last 10 years. And an older AC is very similar to an old car \u2013 both become less efficient and use more energy to operate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduced Electricity Bills<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With yearly maintenance, an AC unit is bound to perform more efficiently. This means lesser energy bills for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fewer Repair Bills<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Any problem that could potentially turn into a breakdown can be caught early and repaired by your service specialist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greater Comfort<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When you are taking good care of your AC unit, you know that you can get the parts replaced before they wear out completely and damage the AC. This will give you peace of mind, knowing no huge repair\/replacement bills are going to surprise you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Keeping Your AC Unit Healthy Between Service Calls<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between the yearly tune-up visits, you can follow some tips to keep your cooling system running smoothly:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are not home or out on a vacation, turn up the thermostat so as to lessen the load on your AC.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspect the outdoor AC unit for damage every once in a while and keep the surrounding area free of debris, leaves, weeds, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you notice any leaks, weird noises or sudden change in air temperature that doesn\u2019t match the thermostat, call for AC repair technicians.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check the indoor air vents for any debris, dirt, or other obstructions and get them cleaned out on a monthly basis.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, make sure you replace the air filters every month. If the filters get clogged with dirt and dust, your AC will need to work way harder to cool your home. This not only increases your utility bills but also damages the motor of the system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, dirty air filters hold a lot of harmful contaminants that can compromise the indoor air quality.
