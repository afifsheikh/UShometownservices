Well, it really depends on the current condition of your air conditioner and how old it is. If your AC is 10 or more years old, and it keeps breaking down, you need to ask yourself whether it would cost less to repair it or replace the whole thing. To figure out when it would be best to replace your air conditioner, consider the following factors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Has It Been 10+ Years Since The AC Unit Was Installed?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as you\u2019d like otherwise, air conditioners are not built to last forever. If your AC unit is<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.angieslist.com\/articles\/how-often-does-air-conditioner-need-service.htm#:~:text=Most%20air%20conditioners%20should%20last,is%20founder%20of%20Angie's%20List.\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nearing 15 years<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is definitely going to display a lot of issues that can lead to costly repairs. As these problems start to occur with alarming frequency, it might be more economical for you to buy a new system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest signs of a failing air conditioner is when you need to call a San Antonio ac repair near me for major repairs just 1 year after you last had it serviced. If you spent several hundred dollars just last summer to tune up the AC, and it looks like it\u2019s already breaking down, odds are this will continue to happen every year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Does Your AC Use R-22 Refrigerant?\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your San Antonio ac repair tells you (after an inspection) that the refrigerant needs to be replaced, it\u2019s usually due to a coolant leak. In almost all the older models, R-22 (Freon) used to be the refrigerant. However, now<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/sites\/production\/files\/2015-07\/documents\/phasing_out_hcfc_refrigerants_to_protect_the_ozone_layer.pdf\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">R-22 is being phased out<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the government as well as the manufacturers because of its extremely high emission levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your AC was installed in the late 2000s, it most definitely uses Freon. And if it needs to be refilled, it\u2019s going to cost you a small fortune these days. Your best option, in this case, is to replace the system and buy a modern unit that\u2019s environmentally friendly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Are Your Cooling Bills Getting Steeper?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weather patterns change each year, so it\u2019s natural that your cooling and heating bills will also fluctuate. However, if you notice an incredible spike in your energy bills seemingly out of nowhere, that\u2019s a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16647 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/San-Antonio-AC-Repair-Near-Me600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"san antonio ac repair near me\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/San-Antonio-AC-Repair-Near-Me600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/San-Antonio-AC-Repair-Near-Me600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/San-Antonio-AC-Repair-Near-Me600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>For example, if the difference between April and June is a $20-$30 or more jump in your utility bill (as opposed to a $5 increase between spring and summer that\u2019s the norm), it\u2019s likely that your air conditioner is consuming too much energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the components inside your AC unit might be failing and struggling to perform their most basic functions.
