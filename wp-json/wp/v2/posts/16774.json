Since we spend over 80% of the time indoors, this is crucial for your health. The air indoors gets recycled and you breathe it in over and over again. Here are some things you can do to make the air you breathe a little better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Service Your AC<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/staying-healthy\/easy-ways-you-can-improve-indoor-air-quality\">air<\/a> conditioning unit keeps your home nice and comfortable at whatever steady temperature you prefer. And if you are like most people, you would not be able to live without it. But at the same time, if you don\u2019t properly service your AC unit, it can be detrimental to your health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Clean Air Filters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make sure the <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/ac-installation\/\">indoor air quality<\/a> does not decline, you have to make sure your AC filter is clean. Some filters are meant to be washed with a hose while others are simply replaced. If your AC uses the replaceable ones then your job is easy. You simply open the vent, take the filter out and replace it with a new one.\u00a0 On the other hand, if you have the other type, you must make sure you clean it properly and thoroughly, otherwise, all the dust particles, allergens, etc that it has picked up over time will be pushed back into the air you breathe.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other air filters around the house you should consider changing or cleaning, especially if you have allergies or any respiratory issues. Your vacuum, the dryer, the kitchen vents, all of these should be inspected and if needed, cleaned out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vents And Air Ducts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have someone do your <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/ac-installation\/\">duct cleaning <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/ac-installation\/\">vent cleaning<\/a> periodically. When you neglect air ducts the air in your home becomes compromised. The cold air traveling through these ducts condenses water which results in mold. Given enough time, most ducts will start to grow mold and if left unchecked, the AC unit will distribute this mold along with other contaminants that gather from lack of cleaning which will make the home smell bad and will possibly harm your respiratory system. Always hire a professional to make sure the air circulating your home is fresh and clean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Clean Your Rugs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carpets and rugs can gather dust and dirt under the surface. These particles eventually make it to the air where they travel into your lungs. If you have ever shaken a rug you know just how bad it can be, this is because most vacuum cleaners can only go so deep.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reach Out To Us<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what services your home needs, you have reached the right site.
