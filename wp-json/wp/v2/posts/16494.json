Exposure to radon can cause several health problems including lung cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most radon exposure occurs inside workplaces, schools, and homes.

If you live in a humid area or your house is damp, you are bound to have a mold problem that can cause all sorts of breathing issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humidity is also an important factor. If humidity is too high in your house, it will lead to mold, dust mites, and even water damage. If too low, it will cause rashes, dry skin, and eye irritation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pests<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Cockroaches, dust mites, pests, and even mice are common sources of allergens, especially in urban areas.
