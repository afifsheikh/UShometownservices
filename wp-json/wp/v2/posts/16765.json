Hiring an air duct cleaning company will remove the dust and allergens that build up over time as well as any mold that may have decided to make your home, its home. The rule of thumb is to clean them every 3 years or so, of course, if you live in a very polluted place you may want to act sooner. Likewise, if you live in a paradise with clean fresh air all around, you could probably stretch it. But don&#8217;t wait too long because mold grows even in the cleanest of places. With that in mind, let\u2019s see some of the things you want to know before hiring a <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/air-duct\/\">certified air duct cleaner<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Their Track record<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I know that the company is a <a href=\"https:\/\/nadca.com\/\">NADCA<\/a> member and that they adhere to the environmental protection agency&#8217;s standards, my first question would be how long the company has been in business. The answer may be very telling, the longer they have been in business the more likely they have plenty of experience and a good reputation to go with it. You can look up references online and find reviews that can shed some light on their customer satisfaction as well. If the reviews all sound the same, they may be fake and you should stay away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Insurance and Certifications&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We mentioned that the first thing to check is whether they are certified and members of NADCA but you also need to know if they are responsible and if in the case of an emergency they will be covered by insurance. If the company in question damages your house while doing the cleaning, or someone gets hurt you certainly do not want to get stuck with a bill. Ask to see proof of insurance before the work begins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Guidelines<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask to know what guidelines they follow and whether they use any type of chemical or biocide and in case they do, do your research. Keep in mind that EPA has never approved a biocide for internally insulated duct systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing you need to know before hiring anyone is if they plan on cleaning the entire system, including the AC unit or\/and furnace the supply and the return air ducts, registers, and grills. Also make sure you get a visual inspection once the work is done, if a company does not offer you this, it is probably better to stay away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reach Out To Us<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering if your home would benefit from hiring a certified air duct cleaner?
