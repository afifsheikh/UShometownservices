You may have heard horror stories of homeowners either getting duped by fraudulent home improvement contractors, or being forced to pay a small fortune for less-than-mediocre quality work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are Googling \u201cchimney cleaners in my area\u201d, you need to focus on companies that have a successful track record and glowing customer reviews. This goes without saying; the company must have good reviews online. If the majority of their customers\u2019 testimonials are negative, that\u2019s a major red flag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there\u2019s more to hiring a chimney sweep than their online reviews. In this post, we have outlined some ways you can find the most<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/chimney-cleaning\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reliable chimney cleaners<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in my area, who will take care of your home like it\u2019s their own.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Do Your Homework When Choosing \u201cChimney Cleaners In My Area\u201d<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chimneys, fireplaces, and vents need more regular maintenance than most other areas of your home. Chimneys usually need to be cleaned<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.csia.org\/faq.html#:~:text=How%20often%20should%20I%20have,from%20deposits%2C%20and%20correct%20clearances.\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least once a year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (if not more), and will sometimes need to be repaired and renovated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, when you work with chimney cleaners in my area, you\u2019ll probably want to work with them multiple times a year. So, look for a company that wants to build a long-term relationship with you, instead of just wanting to take your money. Here are a few ways you can find such a trustworthy company:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Cheap Service vs. Quality Service<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no dearth of contractors who offer \u201cfull fireplace and chimney cleaning in $59\u201d or some other similarly (ridiculously) low price. Does it seem too good to be true? You bet that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s tempting to just compare the costs of all the \u201cchimney cleaners in my area\u201d and go with the cheapest option. But this can spell a world of danger for you and your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, if chimneys and venting systems are not inspected and cleaned correctly, it increases the risk of<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20090925005471\/en\/Most-Recent-Chimney-Fire-Statistics-Indicate-Increasing-Importance-of-Annual-Chimney-Sweeping-and-Inspections\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fire accidents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and carbon monoxide poisoning. If a chimney cleaner is cutting corners in taking care of your chimney or fireplace (that\u2019s the only reason why their service is so cheap), they are putting your life at risk, period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, when you are talking to \u201cchimney cleaners in my area\u201d, make sure you ask them what kind of products and services they are able to provide at their quoted prices.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Their Attitude Towards Customers<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s assume you have shortlisted two chimney cleaners in my area: A and B. \u201cA\u201d has a stunning website, amazing reviews, and they seem to know what they are doing.\u00a0 \u201cB\u201d also seems like a judicious option even though their website doesn\u2019t have that \u201cexpensive\u201d look. However, their technicians seemed very warm and caring when you talked to them \u2013 so much so that they made a lasting impression on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who are you more likely to hire? These intangible feelings are the hardest to quantify but they are almost always on the spot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Schedule A Chimney Inspection Today\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s worth the time and effort to find the right people to take care of your home\u2019s HVAC system, chimney, fireplace, and ductwork.
