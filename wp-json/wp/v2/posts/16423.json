Outside debris and small animals can also enter your chimney as time passes, creating an obstruction. A blocked chimney can cause fumes and carbon monoxide to get trapped inside your house, risking disaster for anyone inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are worried about the safety of your chimney, consider calling a<\/span><a href=\"\/services\/chimney-cleaning\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chimney service Allentown<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, PA, to remove any dangerous debris buildup from the interior of your chimney. By scheduling regular cleanings for your chimney, you will keep your family and your property safe regardless of the weather outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Importance of Regular Chimney Cleaning Allentown, PA<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some reasons why getting your chimney serviced on a regular basis is so important:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove Soot<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you use your fireplace, ash and smoke are supposed to waft out of your home via the chimney. As months and years pass, this ash and smoke create a thick layer of soot on the inside of the chimney.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you have experience and special cleaning equipment, you can\u2019t clean this soot by yourself. It\u2019s better to schedule chimney service Allentown, PA on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on how much you use the fireplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove Debris\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the regular chimney cleaning appointments, the cleaners will also extract any debris like critters, small animals, leaves, etc. from your chimney. If left inside, this debris can clog the chimney, compromising the air quality inside your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is crucial that smoke goes out of the chimney and doesn\u2019t remain inside your home, otherwise it can cause breathing issues for your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove Creosote<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creosote is a black\/dark brown tar-like substance that can accumulate inside your chimney over time. It is formed by wood or charcoal that burns inside the fireplace. Eventually, creosote can totally clog the chimney and stop the smoke from billowing out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this happens, the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning increases tenfold. In fact,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.csia.org\/chimneyfires.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">studies show<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that creosote is the #1 cause of chimney fires. To protect your family from any creosote-related accidents, schedule a chimney cleaning Allentown, PA, before starting up your fireplace for the season.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased Efficiency\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16424 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Keep-Your-Home-Safe-Keep-Your-Family-Warm-Why-Routine-Chimney-Service-is-a-Must-600-x-600-300x300.png\" alt=\"chimney service allentown pa\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Keep-Your-Home-Safe-Keep-Your-Family-Warm-Why-Routine-Chimney-Service-is-a-Must-600-x-600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Keep-Your-Home-Safe-Keep-Your-Family-Warm-Why-Routine-Chimney-Service-is-a-Must-600-x-600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Keep-Your-Home-Safe-Keep-Your-Family-Warm-Why-Routine-Chimney-Service-is-a-Must-600-x-600-320x320.png 320w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Keep-Your-Home-Safe-Keep-Your-Family-Warm-Why-Routine-Chimney-Service-is-a-Must-600-x-600-360x360.png 360w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Keep-Your-Home-Safe-Keep-Your-Family-Warm-Why-Routine-Chimney-Service-is-a-Must-600-x-600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>A clean chimney is bound to work way better than a dirty one. Unclean chimneys are not able to filter smoke out of the house due to all the debris and creosote buildup. As a result, it will fill your house with smoke and toxic gases instead of warmth from the wood.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased Safety<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The safety of a chimney completely depends on how clean and well-maintained it is. As time goes by, creosote that\u2019s created from the fire travels through the smoke and gets accumulated on the chimney walls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can be extremely dangerous, especially if you use the fireplace on a frequent basis. Creosote is combustible in nature and it can catch fire from the burning embers. The very last thing you want is something that flammable trapped above a fire. In addition, it can also cause<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/conditions\/carbon-monoxide-poisoning\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carbon monoxide poisoning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Your Family\u2019s Safety and Comfort is Our Topmost Priority<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At United Home Services, we pride ourselves on being the best home service provider in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
