But the local homeowners know that the nights get pretty here cold in November and December. And just imagine, it\u2019s December, and you wake up in the middle of the night because your home is freezing cold. Your thermostat reads 54 degrees \u2013 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that\u2019s bad<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can\u2019t call the furnace repair technician until morning \u2013 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that\u2019s worse<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t want a similar scenario playing out in your life, it\u2019s time to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/locations\/texas\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">schedule an appointment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a furnace cleaning service near me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A neglected furnace can break down at any moment, and cause a lot of headaches for you and your family. Not sure whether you need to call a furnace cleaning service near me yet? Here are a few signs that indicate your furnace desperately needs some TLC.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>5 Reasons To Call A Furnace Cleaning Service Near Me\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Furnace Is Producing No Heat<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with the most obvious sign. If the furnace is not generating any heat, there could be an issue with the filter or the heat exchanger. The filters inside the furnace trap a lot of dirt and dust over time, becoming clogged. This can prevent the furnace from maintaining airflow. It could also be an overly-heated heat exchanger that may have shut off before warming up your house. Only an expert \u201cfurnace cleaning service near me\u201d can diagnose the issue and handle it effectively.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weird Odors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A faint smell of burnt fuel is normal with oil and gas furnaces. However, if the smell is too strong and overwhelming in rooms that are closer to the furnace, call a furnace cleaning service \u201cnear me\u201d right away.\u00a0 When you turn on your furnace and the smell of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sulfur<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rotten egg<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> soon follows, it could be due to a natural<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qaJ7JWWsGfs\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gas leak in your home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And if you notice an electrical or metallic smell after turning on the furnace, it could be due to the overheating or burning of the inside components of the unit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of what type of odor it is, simply turn off the furnace immediately and call a furnace cleaning company as soon as possible. This is a very serious concern and can result in devastating consequences if not addressed right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unexpectedly High Energy Bills<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you notice that you get significantly higher energy bills in the months when you use your furnace, it\u2019s highly likely that the unit is not functioning at its peak efficiency. Maybe your furnace has become too old, or maybe some of its components need to be replaced.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carbon Monoxide Detector Goes Off<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16646 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Texas-Furnace-Cleaning-Service-Near-Me600x600-300x300.png\" alt=\"furnace cleaning service near me\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Texas-Furnace-Cleaning-Service-Near-Me600x600-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Texas-Furnace-Cleaning-Service-Near-Me600x600-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Texas-Furnace-Cleaning-Service-Near-Me600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>If your<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carbon_monoxide_detector\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carbon monoxide detector<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> goes off soon after turning on the furnace, switch the unit off, and call a furnace technician immediately. Inhaling too much of this gas can be lethal. In fact, we recommend you shut off all the gas appliances in your home and open the windows. Also, call the fire department before you call a furnace repair expert.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furnace Keeps Breaking Down<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve repaired your furnace more than once in the last 2 years, it\u2019s a sure-shot sign that the unit needs to be tuned up thoroughly. This is especially true if your furnace is over 10 years old.
