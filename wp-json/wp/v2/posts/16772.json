This extra strain on your unit is usually not enough to make any real difference on the wear and tear but sometimes, especially on crazy hot days, it can push your unit past the brink. This is the last thing you need, especially in summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Summer Temperatures<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is here and with it the hottest temperatures of the year. This can be very enjoyable, going to the pool or just riding your bike, especially when at the end of that ride, you finally come home and soak up the cold air taking a break from the heat. On the other hand, if your AC unit is blowing warm air, summer can feel like a cruel joke. Did you know that the record in Kansas City is 107 degrees Fahrenheit? At that temperature even if you have a fan in front of you, it would just move the heat around making sure you were getting well done on all sides.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleeping in the heat while sweating is probably the worst part, not that suffering the heat during the day is any fun. But thankfully there is a simple way to turn things around and enjoy summer again, just call your Kansas City <a href=\"https:\/\/ushometownservices.com\/services\/ac-installation\/\">AC repair<\/a> company.\u00a0 Keep in mind that these temperature records are being shattered every year because of global warming, making your air conditioning unit work harder; give it some TLC, and have it inspected by the pros at United Home Services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reasons Your AC Unit Is Down<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different reasons why your AC unit may not be working properly. Among the most common reasons is the thermostat having a problem and not being able to detect the correct temperature. This causes the unit to shut off even if the temperature in the house is crazy hot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes the circuit breaker can be the culprit, if this is the case, make sure to give your unit about 15 minutes after resetting the power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another common problem is that the evaporator coil freezes over. This may be caused by clogged ducts. If your unit is low on refrigerant due to a leak somewhere in the system your AC will blow warm air.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last, on the list, there may be a part that has broken somewhere in the system and you will need a professional to take a look and evaluate the situation. Even if your unit is working, it is a good idea to have a professional inspect it at least once a year; this usually prevents bigger problems and keeps your costs down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reach Out To Us<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need your home serviced in any way, you have reached the right place.
