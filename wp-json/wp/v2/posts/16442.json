Just because you haven\u2019t seen any roaches in your house doesn\u2019t mean they are not there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exposure to airborne roach debris can cause young children to develop asthma and if you already have it, you could suffer regular attacks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heart issues<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/sciencematters\/linking-air-pollution-and-heart-disease#:~:text=Using%20the%20air%20quality%20and,some%20participants'%20risk%20for%20heart\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies have found<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that when adults are exposed to polluted indoor air for extended periods, they develop accelerated cases of atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. The pollutants can directly contribute to plaque buildup around your heart, increasing the risk of heart attacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to developing health issues, you will also be subjected to high energy bills no thanks to dirty indoor air. The more contaminants floating around in your home, the faster your HVAC system gets clogged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So check the air filters every month for dirt\/debris buildup and replace them as required.

We recommend choosing HVAC air filters that come with MERV (minimum efficiency reporting values) of 5 or higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air filters with MERVs between 7 and 13 are considered most effective as they can trap over 90% of passing pollutant particles. If you or someone in your family suffers from asthma or allergies, an air filter with MERV 11 or 12 will be the best option for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Keep Your Family Safe with Premium Air Duct Cleaning and Installation Services<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you afraid your home\u2019s air quality might be contributing to your health issues?
