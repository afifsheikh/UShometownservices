As suggested by the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nadca.com\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Air Duct Cleaners Association<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the residential air ducts should be cleaned every 3 to 5 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it depends on where you live, how often you use your HVAC system, and if anyone in your home has asthma or allergies. If you live in a humid part of the country, or you suffer from asthma, it\u2019s recommended to clean the air ducts every 2 to 3 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>When is a Good Time To Call Air Ducts Cleaner Near Me<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggests that homeowners should get their air ducts cleaned when:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see a noticeable pool of dust released from the supply registers (when air exits the vents);<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see rodents or insects entering\/exiting ductwork or infestation of vermin anywhere in the home;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You suspect the presence of mold in the air ducts.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look inside your air vent register to check any pollutants.

There will be dust particles that enter the system somehow or escape through the filter. Just because you have a filter doesn\u2019t mean your ducts don\u2019t need any cleaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is particularly true for homeowners who live in an area that is especially dusty\/windy, is surrounded by construction, or has high pollution. Your air ducts are going to collect contaminants very quickly and then get clogged up, compromising the indoor air quality in your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So clean out your air ducts every 2-3 years and change your filters twice a year. If you have never hired a \u201cair ducts cleaner near me\u201d for professional cleaning and have been consistently active for over 3 years, it is high time you called in the cleaners.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Benefits of Regular Air Ducts Cleaning<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been evidence that a thorough air duct cleaning can help manage the respiratory issues. If you suffer from allergies, then dander and pollen can be problematic for you. Similarly, if you have asthma, you know your #1 enemy is dust mites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these pollutants are microscopic in nature and are usually found in air ducts. The only way to remove substances like pollen, dust, and dirt from the ducts is by thoroughly cleaning the whole system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any good \u201cair ducts cleaner near me\u201d worth its salt will use a rotary brush cabling system and a negative air machine to clean your duct system. The rotary brush knocks the debris loose inside the ducts, while and air machine removes it completely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Trusted and Reliable Clean Air Solutions in Dallas, TX<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At United Home Services, our certified and skilled air ducts cleaning specialists are committed to helping families stay safe and healthy.
